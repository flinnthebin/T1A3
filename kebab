# kebab - remaps directories and files to use kebab-case naming convention. 
# the kebab-case format was selected as it is not commonly associated with programming languages, making it a convenient choice for organizing a linux filesystem
# the purpose of the script is to simplify and standardize navigation within the filesystem.
# feature 1 - create a backup of the original directory tree in case of user error
# feature 2 - print file information for the items that have been reorganized
# feature 3 - rename a directory tree to kebab case

# use case: standardization of repositories cloned from github to keep navigation across a system uniform.
